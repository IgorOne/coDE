Easy to learn because most of the stuff is there where you expect it to be (not like complete new layouts like DVORAK or NEO). \r\n\r\nEssentially its a [us-keyboard-layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KB_United_States-NoAltGr.svg) with some alterations:\r\n\r\n* `Z` and `Y` are where german speaking people like it. (`Z` is between `T` and `U`, `Y` left of `X`)\r\n* your umlauts, `€` and `ß` work with `option-key` / `alt` + base-key:\r\n    * `option` + `A` = `ä`\r\n    * `option` + `shift` + `A` = `Ä`\r\n    * `option` + `O` = `ö`\r\n    * `option` + `shift` + `O` = `Ö`\r\n    * `option` + `U` = `ü`\r\n    * `option` + `shift` + `U` = `Ü`\r\n    * `option` + `S` = `ß`\r\n    * `option` + `E` = `€`\r\n* `~` (tilde / unix-home) is on two places:\r\n    * `shift` + `` ` `` (us-standard)\r\n    * on the extra key on ISO-keyboards, between `left-shift` and `Y` (extra key: yay!)\r\n* `°` (degree) is on `shift` + the extra ISO-key (between `left-shift` and `Y`)\r\n* all dead-keys are disabled, so if you hit `` ` ``, `~` or `^` you get `` ` ``, `~` or `^`\r\n* 'period' on the numblock produces `,` not `.`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nCopy `coDE.keylayout` into `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` and pick `coDE` as layout in the preference pane.\r\n\r\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/bmaeser/code/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-42916780-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
